# Pet-Tracking-System
. The pet tracking system is designed and implemented to track the pet animals equipped with it from any location at any time.
The proposed pet tracking system make the good use of new tools and technologies which combines the smartphone of the user with Arduino. 
The device is easy to make, inexpensive compare to other tracking system yet efficient.
The device function using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) technology.
The device is attached to the collar of the pet animals. An Arduino is used to control the GPS receiver and GSM module.
The GPS module get the geographic co-ordinates and sends the data to the Arduino. Arduino then sends the data to the smart phone as SMS using the GSM module.
The google map link of the device location is send to the user SMS. On click, it will directly open the google maps and pins the location.
